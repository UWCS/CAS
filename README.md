Centralized Authentication Service


###Running the service

The configuration of the application is stored in an instance folder. To get the application running on your own computer, you will need to create this under the root (CAS). Next, configuration values for flask are stored in a file called ``config.py``.

Things you can configure are documented here: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/config/
